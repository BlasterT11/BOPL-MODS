# BOPL-MODS
DISCLAIMER: Mods were not made by me. I am just taking these mods and making them accessible for people without da discord. 
The only mod needed is the mod manager ZIP file because it can download the other mods.

How to use mods. For this tutorial, I am going to be explaining using the mod manager.
Step one: Extract the files into a new folder.
Step Two: Open the "BoplModManager" application. A screen should pop up saying Windows finds the file malicious. This is not true. Click run anyway.
Step Three: The manager should ask for you to lead it to Bopl Battle. You can find the application by looking in Steam and local files, or find it through your Program Files (86x)
Step Four: Press the install Bepinex button. Bepinex is a commonly used modding tool.
Step Five: Click on the mods you want to get. Then press install mods.
Step Six: If you want to remove a mod, you will have to go into the plugins folder of your Bopl Battle game and delete the plugins.
Step Seven: Enjoy!
